## 🔍 About the Project

Cloudbursts can cause sudden floods and landslides. Accurate and early prediction is crucial, especially in hilly and coastal regions.  
This ML model is trained on weather patterns to classify the possibility of a cloudburst based on:
- Humidity (%)
- Temperature (°C)
- Atmospheric Pressure (hPa)
- Wind Speed (m/s)

The final model predicts whether conditions are favorable for a **cloudburst (Yes/No)**.
